</div>

<p class='c000'>Yes, my friend, I can resolve your question. Twenty years of
actual experience qualify one to reply. I have stood, as you now
stand, on the threshold of this grandest undertaking of any age—this
effort to elevate a whole people in the scale of moral being—with
my head full of plans, and my heart of devotedness, asking
the same question. I really longed for this coming of millennial
glory, and therefore soon found the road on which to go forth to
meet it. My disgust was unutterable, as yours, too, will be, if you
desire the abolition of slavery more than the temporary triumph of
sect or party, at the stupid schemes by which selfish men were
then, as now, trying to make capital for themselves out of the
sacred cause of human rights—seeking to sell the gift of the Holy
Ghost for money. Hear them clamorously and meanly taking advantage
of ignorance, for the promotion of self-interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>First, hear the agents of slavery presenting the colonization scheme
as the instrument of abolition.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aid the Colonization Society.” Yes; to make slavery stronger
by exalting prejudice as an ordination of divine Providence; to
make slavery safer by eliminating that dangerous element, the free
black; to make its term longer by stultifying national conscience.
See that society making the laws of slave States more cruel, the
men of the free States more obdurate, the situation of the free men
of color more difficult and insupportable, as a part of its plan. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>could not, if it would, transport three millions of souls to Africa;
the navies and revenues of the world would be insufficient. It
would not, if it could; for slavery has no intention of parting with
its three millions of victims; unless induced to free them out of
generosity, it will keep them on speculation. Its forty years of colonization
labor, and its million of gold and silver, have exiled
fewer to Liberia than have escaped into Canada in spite of it—less
in that period than the monthly increase of the slaves! It
can do nothing for Christianizing Africa, for it sends a slaveholding
gospel, which is anti-Christ. Be not deceived, then, by a tyrannical
mockery like this, working to perpetuate slavery, and not to
abolish it. Aid the American Anti-Slavery Society, which deals
with the heart and conscience of this slaveholding nation, demanding
immediate, unconditional emancipation, without expatriation;
the abolition of slavery by the spirit of repentance, in conformity
with all your own principles and traditions, whether religious or
political.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hear another cry, (coming, not like the first, from the enemies of
abolition, but from friends, generally those of more pretension than
devotedness:) “Form a political party, free soil or other, to vote
down slavery.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Yes, don’t <em>kill</em> the growing monster—call to him to stop growing;
merge immediatism, which always succeeds, in gradualism, which
never does. Substitute a secondary object for the primary one.
Strive in the first place not to abolish slavery, but to get one set of
men out of office and another in, to learn by the event that the last
are as incapable to turn back the whirlpool that masters the government
as the first were. Make an appeal to force of numbers in a
case where you know it is against you; in a case, too, where, having
sworn assistance, you must lose influence by such an appeal.
Spend your time and money, not in making new abolitionists, but
in counting the old ones, that at every count diminish. Politics, in
the common, small sense of the term, merely takes the circumstances
it finds, and does its best with them. But the present circumstances
are unfavorable. <span class='sc'>Then create new ones.</span> This is true politics,
in the enlarged, real meaning of the word. Here is a building to
be erected, and no sufficient materials. A <em>little</em> untempered mortar,
a <em>few</em> unbaked bricks—that is all. Go to the deep quarries of the
human heart, and make of your sons and daughters polished stones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>to build the temple of the Lord. It is this cleaving into the living
rock the <span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery Society</span> girds itself to do.
Under its operations men become better and better abolitionists.
Under the labors of political partisanship they necessarily grow
worse and worse. They must ever ask themselves how <em>little</em> anti-slavery
feeling and principle they can make serve the temporary
turn; because the less of either, the greater the chance. They must
always be sacrificing the end to the means. Call them to the witness
box in their capacity of philosophical observers, and out of
their little circumventing political characters, and themselves will
tell you that the effect of electioneering on anti-slavery is most unfavorable,
adding to the existing opposition to right the fury of party
antagonism, throwing away the balance of power, lowering the tone
of moral and religious feeling and action, and thus letting a sacred
enterprise degenerate into a scramble for office. But labor with the
<span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery Society</span> <em>directly</em> to the great end, and
even Franklin Pierce and Co., pro-slavery as they are, will grovel to
do your bidding. The administration now <em>on</em> the throne is as good
for your bidding as any other. In a republican land the power behind
the throne is <em>the</em> power. Save yourself the trouble of calling
caucuses, printing party journals, distributing ballots, and the like.
Let men who are fit for nothing of more consequence do this little
work, which is best done by mere nobodies. <em>More</em> than enough of
them are always ready for it. You, who are smitten by the sacred
beauty of the great cause, should serve it greatly. Don’t drag the
engine, like an ignoramus, but bring wood and water and flame,
like an engineer. The <span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery Society</span> has
laid the track.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Buy slaves and set them free.” Yes; lop the branches and
strengthen the root; make the destruction of the system more difficult
by practising upon it; create a demand for the slave breeder to
supply; compromise with crime; raise the market price, when you
ought to stop the market; put a philanthropic mark upon the slave
trade; spend money enough in buying one man to free fifty gratis,
and convert a thousand. But there is a <em>wholesale</em> way, cries one.
“Sell the public lands, and set every means in motion, from the
merely mercantile donation of a million to the infant cent society, and
thus raise two thousand millions of dollars, and beg the slaveholders
to take it, (not as compensation, but as a token of good will,) and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>let their bondmen go.” I marvel at this insufficient notion of the
heart of a slaveholder. I wonder exceedingly at such a want of
imagination. “Not as compensation” is well put; for what sum
can compensate a monarch for his throne? This system of slavery
makes the south the parent of long lines of princes. It gives to her
diabolical dominions</p>

<p class='c004'>“Kingdoms, and sway, and strength, and length of days.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I am strangely divided in sympathy. I feel at once the generosity
of the proposal, and have the feeling of contempt with which its
insufficient inappropriateness is received.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Organize vigilance committees, and establish underground railroads.”
Yes; hide from tyranny, instead of defying it; <em>whisper</em> a
testimony; form a bad habit of mind in regard to despotism; try to
keep out the sea with a mop, when you ought to build a dike; flatter
your sense of compassion by taking private retail measures to
have suffering ameliorated, when you might, with the <span class='sc'>American
Anti-Slavery Society</span>, be taking public wholesale measures to
have <em>wrong</em> (the cause of suffering) <em>righted</em>. You may safely leave
with the half and quarter converted, with the slaveholders, nay,
even with the Curtises, the charge of all these things, which without
the American Anti-Slavery Society are but as hydrogen and
nitrogen without oxygen, however good with it, as the natural fruits
of its labors. What I would discourage is, not mercy and compassion
in an individual case, but a disgraceful mistake in the economy
of well doing; spending in salving a sore finger what would
buy the elixir vitæ; preferring the less, which <em>ex</em>cludes the greater,
to the greater, which <em>in</em>cludes the less. Slavery can only be abolished
by raising the character of the people who compose the nation;
and <em>that</em> can be done only by showing them a higher one.
Now, there is <em>one</em> thing that can’t be done in <em>secret</em>; you can’t <em>set a
good example under a bushel</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But instruction! instruction! found schools and churches for
the blacks, and thus <em>prepare</em> for the abolition of slavery.” O, shallow
and shortsighted! the <em>demand</em> is the <em>preparation</em>; nothing can
supply the place of <em>that</em>. And <em>exclusive</em> instruction, teaching for
<em>blacks</em>, a school founded on color, a church in which men are herded
ignominiously, apart from the refining influence of association with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the more highly educated and accomplished,—what are they? A
direct way of fitting white men for tyrants, and black men for slaves.
No; if you would teach and Christianize the nation, strengthen the
<span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery Society</span>, the <em>only</em> American institution
founded on the Christian and republican idea of the equal brotherhood
of man, and in opposition to a church and state which deny
human brotherhood by sanctioning slavery, and pull down Christ to
their own level. The American Anti-Slavery Society is church and
university, high school and common school to all who need real
instruction and true religion. Of it what a throng of authors, editors,
lawyers, orators, and accomplished gentlemen of color have
taken their degree! It has equally implanted hopes and aspirations,
noble thoughts and sublime purposes in the hearts of both races.
It has prepared the white man for the freedom of the black man,
and it has made the black man scorn the thought of enslavement,
as does a white man, as far as its influence has extended. <em>Strengthen
that noble influence.</em> Before its organization, the country only saw
here and there in slavery some “faithful Cudjoe or Dinah,” whose
strong natures blossomed even in bondage, like a fine plant beneath
a heavy stone. Now, under the elevating and cherishing influence
of the American Anti-Slavery Society, the colored race, like
the white, furnishes Corinthian capitals for the noblest temples.
Aroused by the American Anti-Slavery Society, the very white men
who had forgotten and denied the claim of the black man to the
rights of humanity now thunder that claim at every gate, from cottage
to capital, from school house to university, from the railroad
carriage to the house of God. He has a place at their firesides, a
place in their hearts—the man whom they once cruelly hated for
his color. So feeling, they <em>cannot</em> send him to Coventry with a horn-book
in his hand, and call it <em>instruction</em>! They inspire him to climb
to their side by a visible acted gospel of freedom. Thus, instead
of bowing to prejudice, they conquer it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Establish free-labor warehouses.” Indeed! is that a good business
calculation that leads to expend in search of the products of
free labor the time and money that would make all labor free?
While wrong exists in the world, you cannot (short of suicide) but
draw your every life breath in involuntary connection with it; nor
is conscience to be satisfied with any thing short of a complete devotion
to the anti-slavery cause of the life that is sustained by slavery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>We <em>may</em> draw good out of evil: we <em>must not</em> do evil, that
good may come. Yet I counsel you to honor those who eat no
sugar, as <em>you</em> ask no questions for conscience’s sake; while you
despise those who thrust forward such a call upon conscience, <em>impossible</em>,
in the nature of things, to be obeyed, and therefore not
binding, as if it were the end of the law for righteousness, in order
to injure Garrison, the great and good founder of the American Anti-Slavery
Society. I have seen men stand drawing bills of exchange
between England and the United States, while uttering maledictions
against the American Anti-Slavery Society, because it does
not, as such, occupy itself with the free produce question. This I
brand as pro-slavery in disguise—sheer hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c000'>You see, my friend, that I have replied to your question in the
conviction that you desire the abolition of slavery above all other
things in this world; as one assured that it is the great work of
Christianity in our age and country, as the conflict with idolatry was
in other times and climes. Thus you see the salvation of the souls,
the maintenance of the rights, the fulfilment of the duties, and the
preservation of the free institutions of Americans, to depend upon
the extirpation of this accursed and disgraceful disease which is
destroying them. If I had reason to think you merely desirous to
make sectarian and political capital out of a holy thought and a
sacred purpose originated by others—if you were merely contriving
defences for what is indefensible, and trying to save the credit of
what is disgraceful, trying to throw dust, and change the issue, and
pay tithes of cumin to delay justice, in order to spare your own
insignificant self in this greatest conflict of light and darkness, good
and evil, which the world has now to show—if you had been trying
how to <em>seem</em> creditably interested in what ought to be an American’s
first business, and calculating <em>how little</em> instead of <em>how much</em>
you might sacrifice to the soul-exalting cause of freedom—if you
were but trying to get yourself or some friend into office by the
judicious use of ideas which, as a republican and a Christian, you
ought to give yourself wholly to be used by—if you were the hired
agent of some demisemiquaver of a movement which tacked anti-slavery
to its other titles, in order to establish a claim on the purses
of abolitionists—in any of these cases I would not have stopped to
talk with you. Your interest being the thing you had at heart, I
should not <em>counsel</em>; I should be called, in the name of all that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>holy, to <em>condemn</em> you, in order that blame might awaken conscience.
But the case, I trust, is different. I may, then, say to you, with all
the confidence, nay, certainty, which is inseparable from experience,
knowledge, and utter self-abnegation in the matter, <span class='sc'>Work with
the American Anti-Slavery Society</span>. Lavish your time, your
money, your labors, your prayers, in that field, which is the world,
and you will reap a thousand fold, now and hereafter. This movement
<em>moves</em>. It is alive. Hear how every thing mean and selfish
struggles, hisses, and dies under its influence. Never, since the
world was, has any effort been so clear, so strong, so uncompromising,
so ennobling, so holy, and, let me add, so successful. It is “the
bright consummate flower” of the Christianity of the nineteenth
century. Look at those who “have not resisted the heavenly vision”
it presented them of a nation overcoming its evil propensities, and
doing right at all risks; ask <em>them</em> whether it has not saved their souls
alive; ask <em>them</em> if it has not made them worshippers of the beauty
and sublimity of high character, till they are ready to “know nothing
on earth but Jesus Christ and him crucified.” For this they
give all—wealth, youth, health, strength, life. Worldly success,
obtained by slackening their labors against slavery, (and it is easy
to have it on those terms at any moment, so placable a monster is
the world,) strikes them like failure and disgrace. They have
“scorned delights, and lived laborious days,” till at length they feel
it no sacrifice, but the highest joy. All this the American Anti-Slavery
Society demands of <em>you</em>. <span class='sc'>Do it!</span> and be most grateful for
the opportunity of fulfilling a work which is its own exceeding great
reward. <span class='sc'>Do it</span>, and find yourself the chosen of God, to keep alive
in this nation, degraded and corrupted by slavery, the noble flame
of Christian faith, the sentiment of honor and fidelity, the instinct
of high-mindedness, the sense of absolute, immutable duty, the
charm of chivalrous and poetic feeling, which would make of the
poorest Americans the Christian gentlemen of the world.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Cherish all these high feelings that become</div>
      <div class='line'>A giver of the gift of liberty.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>You will find yourself under the necessity of doing it in <em>this</em> noble
company, or <em>alone</em>. Try it. Strive to be perfect, as God is perfect—to
act up to your own highest idea, in connection with church or
state in this land corrupted by slavery, and see if you are helped or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>hindered. Be not dragged along by them protesting. It is graceing
as a slave the chariot wheels of a triumph. But flee from them, as
one flees out of Babylon. Secure the blessing of union for good,
and be delivered from the curse of union in evil, by acting with the
<span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery Society</span>, its members and friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>I use this mode of expression advisedly, for I am not speaking of
a mere form of association. Many are in harmonious coöperation
with it who have neither signed the constitution nor subscribed the
annual half dollar. Hence it is neither a formality nor a ceremony,
but a united, onward-flowing current of noble lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, then, you feel that devotedness of heart which I verily think
your question indicates, I feel free to counsel you to go <em>immediately</em>
to the nearest office of the American Anti-Slavery Society,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a> by letter,
if not in person, subscribe what money you can afford—the
first fruits of a life-long liberality, and <em>study</em> the cause like a science,
while promoting it like a gospel, under the cheering and helpful
sympathy of some of the best company on earth; <em>but not unless</em>;
for <em>this</em> company despises what politicians, ecclesiastical and other,
call “getting people committed.” They have a horror of this selfish
invasion of another’s freedom, as of the encumbrance of selfish
help. They warn you not to touch the ark with unhallowed hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>One consideration more—the thought of what you owe to your
forerunners in what you feel to be the truth. It is, to follow meekly
after, and be baptized with the baptism that they are baptized with.
“Thus it <em>becometh</em> us to fulfil all righteousness;” and the more your
talents, gifts, and graces may, in your own judgment, be superior to
theirs, the more <em>becoming</em> it will be to seek their fellowship; for in
the whole land they, and <em>they alone</em>, <em>are right</em>. It is not eulogy, but
fact, that theirs is the path of the just, shining more and more unto
the perfect day—denied only by the besotted with injustice, the
committed to crime. Consider, then, not only what you owe to your
slavery-cursed country, your enslaving as well as enslaved countrymen,
your fathers’ memory, your remotest posterity, the Christian
religion, which forbids the sacrifice of one man’s rights to another
man’s interests, and which knows no distinction of caste, color, or
condition,—but consider, also, what you owe to those individuals
and to that brotherhood who have battled twenty years in the breach
for <em>your</em> freedom, involved with that of the meanest slave.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Imagine how the case stood with those who perished by suffocation
in the Black Hole at Calcutta. Suppose that some of their number
had felt the sublime impulse to place their bodies in the door,
and the high devoted hearts to stand the crushing till dawn awoke
the tyrant; the <em>rest</em> of that doomed band might have passed out
alive. This is what the American Anti-Slavery Society has been
unflinchingly doing for you, and for the rest of the nation, amid
torture, insult, and curses, through a long night of terror and despair.
The life of the land, its precious moral sense, has been thus kept
from suffocation. The free agitating air of faithful speech has
saved it. The soul of the United States is not dead, thanks, under
Providence, to that noble fellowship of resolute souls, to find whom
the nation has been winnowed. Do your duty by them, in the
name of self-respect. Such companionship is an honor accorded
to but few, and of that worthy few I would fain count you one.
Strike, then, with them at the existence of slavery, and you will see
individual slaves made free, anti-slavery leaven introduced into
parties and churches, instruction diffused, the products of free labor
multiplied, and fugitives protected, in exact proportion to the energy
of the grand onset against the civil system.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c009'>
    <div>FORMED IN PHILADELPHIA, DECEMBER 4, 1833.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Whereas the Most High God “hath made of one blood all nations
of men to dwell on all the face of the earth,” and hath commanded
them to love their neighbors as themselves; and whereas
our national existence is based upon this principle, as recognized
in the Declaration of Independence, “that all mankind are created
equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness;” and whereas, after the lapse of nearly sixty years,
since the faith and honor of the American people were pledged to
this avowal before Almighty God and the world, nearly one sixth
part of the nation are held in bondage by their fellow-citizens; and
whereas slavery is contrary to the principles of natural justice, of
our republican form of government, and of the Christian religion,
and is destructive of the prosperity of the country, while it is endangering
the peace, union, and liberties of the States; and whereas
we believe it the duty and interest of the masters immediately to
emancipate their slaves, and that no scheme of expatriation, either
voluntary or by compulsion, can remove this great and increasing
evil; and whereas we believe that it is practicable, by appeals to
the consciences, hearts, and interests of the people, to awaken a
public sentiment throughout the nation that will be opposed to the
continuance of slavery in any part of the republic, and by effecting
the speedy abolition of slavery, prevent a general convulsion; and
whereas we believe we owe it to the oppressed, to our fellow-citizens
who hold slaves, to our whole country, to posterity, and to God,
to do all that is lawfully in our power to bring about the extinction
of slavery, we do hereby agree, with a prayerful reliance on the
divine aid, to form ourselves into a society to be governed by the
following constitution:—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><span class='sc'>Article I.</span>—This society shall be called the <span class='sc'>American Anti-Slavery
Society</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article II.</span>—The objects of this society are the entire abolition
of slavery in the United States. While it admits that each State
in which slavery exists has, by the constitution of the United States,
the exclusive right to <em>legislate</em> in regard to its abolition in said State,
it shall aim to convince all our fellow-citizens, by arguments addressed
to their understandings and consciences, that slaveholding
is a heinous crime in the sight of God, and that the duty, safety,
and best interests of all concerned require its <em>immediate abandonment</em>,
without expatriation. The society will also endeavor, in a constitutional
way, to influence Congress to put an end to the domestic
slave trade, and to abolish slavery in all those portions of our common
country which come under its control, especially in the District
of Columbia, and likewise to prevent the extension of it to any
State that may be hereafter admitted to the Union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article III.</span>—This society shall aim to elevate the character
and condition of the people of color, by encouraging their intellectual,
moral, and religious improvement, and by removing public
prejudice, that thus they may, according to their intellectual and
moral worth, share an equality with the whites of civil and religious
privileges; but this society will never, in any way, countenance the
oppressed in vindicating their rights by resorting to physical force.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article IV.</span>—Any person who consents to the principles of this
constitution, who contributes to the funds of this society, and is not
a slaveholder, may be a member of this society, and shall be entitled
to vote at the meetings.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article V.</span>—The officers of this society shall be a president,
vice-presidents, a recording secretary, corresponding secretaries, a
treasurer, and an executive committee of not less than five nor more
than twelve members.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article VI.</span>—The executive committee shall have power to
enact their own by-laws, fill any vacancy in their body, and in the
offices of secretary and treasurer, employ agents, determine what
compensation shall be paid to agents and to the corresponding secretaries,
direct the treasurer in the application of all moneys, and
call special meetings of the society. They shall make arrangements
for all meetings of the society, make an annual written
report of their doings, the expenditures and funds of the society,
and shall hold stated meetings, and adopt the most energetic measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in their power to advance the objects of the society. They
may, if they shall see fit, appoint a board of assistant managers,
composed of not less than three nor more than seven persons residing
in New York city, or its vicinity, whose duty it shall be to render
such assistance to the committee in conducting the affairs of
the society as the exigencies of the cause may require. To this
board they may from time to time confide such of their own powers
as they may deem necessary to the efficient conduct of the society’s
business. The board shall keep a record of its proceedings, and
furnish a copy of the same for the information of the committee, as
often as may be required.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article VII.</span>—The president shall preside at all meetings of
the society, or, in his absence, one of the vice-presidents, or, in
their absence, a president pro tem. The corresponding secretaries
shall conduct the correspondence of the society. The recording
secretary shall notify all meetings of the society and of the executive
committee, and shall keep records of the same in separate
books. The treasurer shall collect the subscriptions, make payments
at the direction of the executive committee, and present a
written and audited account to accompany the annual report.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article VIII.</span>—The annual meeting of the society shall be held
each year at such time and place as the executive committee may
direct, when the accounts of the treasurer shall be presented, the
annual report read, appropriate addresses delivered, the officers
chosen, and such other business transacted as shall be deemed expedient.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article IX.</span>—Any anti-slavery society or association founded
on the same principles may become auxiliary to this society. The
officers of each auxiliary society shall be ex officio members of the
parent institution, and shall be entitled to deliberate and vote in the
transactions of its concerns.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Article X.</span>—This constitution may be amended, at any annual
meeting of the society, by a vote of two thirds of the members
present, provided the amendments proposed have been previously
submitted, in writing, to the executive committee.</p>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
